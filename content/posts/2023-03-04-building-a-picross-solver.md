[Picross puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) have long been a favorite passtime of mine.

I know that the puzzles don't necessarily guarantee a unique solution, or even a solution that can be reasonably found using logic alone.

## Formats
I need a format for specifying the puzzle, to be read by my solver. I would like to avoid defining my own format if possible, and I figured someone probably defined a suitable format already.
