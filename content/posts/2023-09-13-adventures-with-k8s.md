title: Moving my setup to Kubernetes
date: 2023-09-13T09:04:30.231Z
---
In the interest of self-flagellation and modernizing my self-hosting setup I've begun moving everything I have to a Kubernetes cluster.

My goal is to have a fairly robust GitOps-based k8s setup, where I no longer have to SSH to a server and perform a number of manual tasks to update and maintain my services. There are of course a *lot* of things to potentially add to such a setup, and this project will probably keep me busy for the next long while. But let's start small.

For now, I've settled on running a single-node [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster on a VM. For this I've chosen a [Hetzner CX31](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) VPS.

My initial goal is as follows:

* Get k3s running on my VM
* Install [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and have it monitor my `home-ops` repo. 
* Set up ingress and LetsEncrypt certificates via [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) and [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).
* Install [Weave GitOps](https://www.weave.works/product/gitops/), to have a neat GUI for managing Flux.
* Have Weave be reachable through an external hostname over HTTPS.

This should serve as a good, solid PoC for running my own cluster with GitOps.

## Installing k3s

The VM has been provisioned and I'm ready to install k3s. K3s deploys its own instance of Traefik by default, so we'll have to disable that as we want to control that part ourselves. The entire install process can be accomplished with this scary `curl`/`sh` oneliner:

```shell
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server --disable traefik" sh -
````

Once the install is complete, a `kubeconfig` file will have been generated for us, that allows us to reach and manage the cluster from the outside, located at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`. We just need to `scp` this back home to our own machine and change the IP to point to the external IP of our VM.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE      NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system    local-path-provisioner-957fdf8bc-knfmv     1/1     Running   0          25h
kube-system    coredns-77ccd57875-pvpbb                   1/1     Running   0          25h
kube-system    metrics-server-648b5df564-lnhws            1/1     Running   0          25h
```

It works. ðŸŽˆ

Fow now (until we get around to setting up some monitoring of the VM) we shouldn't need to access the VM directly again.

## Installing Flux

We're using Flux for GitOps. Flux will monitor a git repository and reconcile whatever is defined there with what is running in the cluster.  For this we'll naturally need a git repository. I've decided to just start from scratch with this, taking inspiration from the [Flux recommended ways](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/) of structuring a repo.

Flux is able to manage itself and its own configuration, but this presents us with a chicken-and-egg problem. Before this runs automatically there are a few manual steps we need to perform.  Enter `flux bootstrap`.

Flux has a CLI that can be used to manage Flux in a cluster, and perform [initial bootstrapping](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/gitlab/). The following command will install the necessary controllers and CRDs in the cluster, commit the corresponding manifests to git, set up Flux to monitor the repository and then finally wait for Flux to reconcile its own state.

```shell
$ flux bootstrap gitlab \
        --owner=cmoesgaard \
        --repository=home-ops \
        --branch=main \
        --path=./kubernetes/flux \
        --personal
```

Checking `flux stats` will show us that everything looks to be in order.

```shell
$ flux stats
RECONCILERS          	RUNNING	FAILING	SUSPENDED	STORAGE
GitRepository        	1      	0      	0        	40.9 KiB

HelmRepository       	0      	0      	0        	-	
HelmChart            	0      	0      	0        	-	
Bucket               	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Kustomization        	1      	0      	0        	-        	
HelmRelease          	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Alert                	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Provider             	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Receiver             	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImageUpdateAutomation	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImagePolicy          	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImageRepository      	0      	0      	0        	-        	
```

From now on, everything merged to the `main` branch in the repo will now be reconciled by Flux. The `kubernetes` directory in my repo roughly has the following structure:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ apps
â”œâ”€â”€ charts
â”œâ”€â”€ flux
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ flux-system
â””â”€â”€ infrastructure
    â”œâ”€â”€ configs
    â””â”€â”€ controllers
```

In order of reconciliation:

* `flux` containing the Flux resources and CRDs and [`Kustomization`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/) manifests for the remaining components allowing Flux to track them too
* `charts` containing [`HelmRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/) manifests for the various apps I intend to install
* `infrastructure` containing general infrastructure that needs to be in place for the cluster to work
  		- `configs` containing things such as general cluster secrets and configuration
  		- `controllers` containing things such as Traefik, Cert Manager and Weave GitOps
* And finally `apps` containing the actual apps I want to self-host

### Secret management

With GitOps we get a lovely paper trail regarding changes to our cluster, with every update or change corresponding to a git commit. We'd like to also have a way to store the various secrets we need as part of this, but without exposing every password and API token to the world. For this, we'll use [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops). SOPS allows us to store our secrets as encrypted files, so that they can be decrypted and read by us and by Flux in the cluster, but not by third parties snooping around my repository. Flux supports SOPS for decrypting secrets [out of the box](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/).

To make this work, we'll need to perform *another* manual step. We'll need to generate a set of encryption keys using `age`:

```shell
$ age-keygen -o age.agekey
Public key: age1vt4lmr873png75lskfhz9ymh29wvnr3gydgzea6w8r7wp4al54lsdhw08a
```

And then store the private key as a secret in the cluster.

```shell
$ cat age.agekey |
kubectl create secret generic sops-age \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

To allow SOPS to decrypt the files, the `age.agekey` must be stored in `~/.config/sops/age` as `keys.txt` (or added to this file if it exists)

We only want SOPS to encrypt specific values inside our files, so we add a `.sops.yaml` file to the root of the repo containing the following, substituting the appropriate public key:

```yaml
---
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: kubernetes/.*\.yaml
    encrypted_regex: "^(data|stringData)$"
    age: age1vt4lmr873png75lskfhz9ymh29wvnr3gydgzea6w8r7wp4al54lsdhw08a
```

SOPS can now be used in the following way to encrypt secrets in-place:

```shell
$ sops -i -e cluster-secrets.yaml
```

Turning a secret like this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: cluster-secrets
    namespace: flux-system
stringData:
    PASSWORD: hunter2
```

Into this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: cluster-secrets
    namespace: flux-system
stringData:
    PASSWORD: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:VYLeI8Ft,iv:A2Ph7+1qOwcfofRt5HLYCfSMQRnQKVz9fn6Jbm9ENO4=,tag:FH8V2kYjNLRZ7mSywKkVKA==,type:str]

          enc: |

    pgp: []
    encrypted_regex: ^(data|stringData)$
    version: 3.7.3
```

Opening the above file with `sops cluster-secrets.yaml` will then allow us to modify the decrypted secret.

Finally, when the `Secret` above is created in the cluster, we need to add the following snippet to the relevant `Kustomization` to tell Flux to decrypt the secret using SOPS and the private key we stored previously:

```yaml
  ...
  decryption:
    provider: sops
    secretRef:
      name: sops-age
  ...
```

The secret is now stored in the cluster as a normal `Secret`:

```shell
$ kubectl get secret -n flux-system cluster-secrets -o jsonpath="{.data.PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode
hunter2                                                                                      
```

## Installing Weave GitOps

With everything in place, it's time to try installing our first non-flux component. [Weave GitOps](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/intro-weave-gitops/) gives us a UI for Flux, which will help us deploy the subsequent components, so let's start there.

We're installing Weave using its Helm chart, so we first have to add a `HelmRepository` manifest for the Weave GitOps Helm repository, allowing Flux to pull the Helm chart from there. The following resources have been adapted from the [Flux example repo](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example/tree/main).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  type: oci
  interval: 60m0s
  url: oci://ghcr.io/weaveworks/charts
```

Then we have to create a `HelmRelease` for the actual helm chart. 

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 60m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: weave-gitops
      version: "*"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: weave-gitops
      interval: 12h
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop:
          - ALL
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1000
    adminUser:
      create: true
      username: admin
      passwordHash: ${WEAVE_PASSWORD_HASH}
```

The `WEAVE_PASSWORD_HASH` is stored as a  `Secret` which we've instructed Flux to use when building the `Kustomization`:

```yaml
  ...
  postBuild:
    substitute: {}
    substituteFrom:
      - kind: Secret
        name: cluster-secrets
  ...
```

The manifests above (and the password hash secret) are commited and pushed to the repo, and now we wait for Flux to do its magic.

```shell
$ flux stats -n flux-system
RECONCILERS          	RUNNING	FAILING	SUSPENDED	STORAGE
GitRepository        	1      	0      	0        	40.9 KiB 	
OCIRepository        	0      	0      	0        	-        	
HelmRepository       	1      	0      	0        	675.5 KiB	
HelmChart            	1      	0      	0        	177.1 KiB	
Bucket               	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Kustomization        	4      	0      	0        	-        	
HelmRelease          	1      	0      	0        	-        	
Alert                	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Provider             	0      	0      	0        	-        	
Receiver             	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImageUpdateAutomation	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImagePolicy          	0      	0      	0        	-        	
ImageRepository      	0      	0      	0        	-        	
```

Everything looks good. âœ¨ We don't have a way of reaching our deployment from the outside yet, but for now we'll just forward a port.

```shell
$ kubectl -n flux-system port-forward svc/weave-gitops 9001:9001
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9001 -> 9001
Forwarding from [::1]:9001 -> 9001
```

It works, hooray!

## What's next?

We've managed to set up the initial cluster with Flux and deployed our first service. We're one step closer to having a fully functioning setup. Next, we'll set up Traefik and Cert Manager so we'll be able to reach our services from the outside.
