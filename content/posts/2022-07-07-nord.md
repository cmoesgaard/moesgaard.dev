I have a somewhat unhealthy fascination with the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color palette. At its base it consists 16 colors that in my opinion are pleasant to look at and help reduce eye-strain when I spend the majority of my waking hours staring at a computer monitor.

The color palette has been [ported to a wide variety of applications](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports) at this point, and I've spent a not insignificant amount of time trying to reskin everything I use, to give everything a uniform look:

It's *wonderful*, right? ðŸ¤©

Much of the software I use (Firefox, VSCode, GTK) has Nord support through addons or plugins, or even support directly built in (as is the case with Joplin and Bitwarden for instance). For a few things, I've had to add support myself (such as my window manager, status bar, etc.) - much of this work can be seen in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/cmoesgaard/dotfiles).

A natural evolution of this was of course to add Nord colorscheme support to the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/) theme I'm using. A little tinkering with a [tailwind color generator](https://tailwindcolorgenerator.com/) and a [helpful guide](https://glacierblocks.com/blog/the-glacier-colorscheme/), and here we are:

```css
:root {
    /* nord3 */
    --color-neutral: 236, 239, 244;

    /* nord0-nord6 - taken from https://glacierblocks.com/blog/the-glacier-colorscheme/ */
    --color-neutral-50: 246, 247, 248;
    --color-neutral-100: 242, 244, 248;
    --color-neutral-200: 236, 239, 244;
    --color-neutral-300: 229, 233, 240;
    --color-neutral-400: 216, 222, 233;
    --color-neutral-500: 76, 86, 106;
    --color-neutral-600: 67, 76, 94;
    --color-neutral-700: 59, 66, 82;
    --color-neutral-800: 46, 52, 64;
    --color-neutral-900: 36, 41, 51;

    /* nord8 */
    --color-secondary-50: 186, 242, 255;
    --color-secondary-100: 176, 232, 248;
    --color-secondary-200: 166, 222, 238;
    --color-secondary-300: 156, 212, 228;
    --color-secondary-400: 146, 202, 218;
    --color-secondary-500: 136, 192, 208;
    --color-secondary-600: 126, 182, 198;
    --color-secondary-700: 116, 172, 188;
    --color-secondary-800: 106, 162, 178;
    --color-secondary-900: 96, 152, 168;

    /* nord9 */
    --color-primary-50: 179, 211, 243;
    --color-primary-100: 169, 201, 233;
    --color-primary-200: 159, 191, 223;
    --color-primary-300: 149, 181, 213;
    --color-primary-400: 139, 171, 203;
    --color-primary-500: 129, 161, 193;
    --color-primary-600: 119, 151, 183;
    --color-primary-700: 109, 141, 173;
    --color-primary-800: 99, 131, 163;
    --color-primary-900: 89, 121, 153;
}
```

The CSS can then just be applied as part of the [configuration](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/advanced-customisation/#colour-schemes).ðŸŽˆ
