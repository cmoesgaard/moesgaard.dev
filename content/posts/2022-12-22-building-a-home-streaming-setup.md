The advent of Netflix and friends meant that I basically stopped pirating TV shows and movies altogether. It's been *years* since I've even thought of it. Sure, you couldn't stream everything, but the selection was so varied that I felt like it was at least good enough to not bother with pirating stuff anymore.

Over the past few years the number of competing streaming services has increased quite dramatically, and as a result, the selection of movies and TV shows has been fragmented and spread across all of these services. If you want to watch a specific movie or TV show, odds are it probably isn't available on one of the streaming services you're subscribed to, or it might not be available for streaming *at all*.

Out of pure *interest*, I decided to do some light investigation into the world of piracy, just to get an idea of what's possible and how hard it would be to set up my own little streaming service with more-or-less feature parity with existing streaming services.

Turns out it's easy. Like, *really* easy.
